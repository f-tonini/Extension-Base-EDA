# Extension-Base-EDA

The Base-EDA (Base Epidemiological Disturbance Agent) extention is created and maintained by the **[Center for Geospatial Analytics](http://cnr.ncsu.edu/geospatial/)**, North Carolina State University, in collaboration with the **[USDA Forest Service Northern Research Station, Institute for Applied Ecosystem Studies](www.fs.fed.us)**. The extension is meant to provide a framework to simulate multi-host asymmetric epidemiological processes for the establishment and transmission of a given disease. The extension will be climate-driven, thus make use of the [LANDIS-II] (http://www.landis-ii.org/) climate library, as most epidemiological agents (pathogens) are influenced by it. Base-EDA is built upon some of the foundations of the Base-BDA (biological disturbance agent) extension, while adding some extra components to it, such as probabilistic and anisotropic dispersal.
